          ENTERPRISE.</p>

          <p>[FROM OUR SPECIAL BOSTON CORRESPONDENT.]</p>

          <p>BOSTON, May 8th, 1870.</p>

          <p>We Bostonians are greatly surprised that your valuable
          journal has as yet taken no notice of the great
          undertaking of the century&mdash;the Cape Cod Canal. However,
          you New-Yorkers are quite out of the world, and unless
          you read the Boston <i>Transcript</i> regularly, can not
          be expected to know much about the enterprises with which
          the earnest men of the nation are occupied. The great
          Cape Cod Canal is, however, not meant simply for the
          benefit of the Bostonian nation, but for the commerce of
          the civilized world. It is destined to work a more
          important revolution in the trade of Plymouth,
          Barnstable, and Nantucket, than the Suez or Darien
          Canals.</p>

          <p>Of course you are familiar with the peculiar
          conformation of Cape Cod. It juts out into the Atlantic
          like an immense elbow, and, indeed, is understood to be
          modelled after the brawny arm of the gallant CHARLES
          SUMNER. Vessels passing between ports on the western and
          those on the southern coast of Massachusetts, are now
          obliged to make a wide <i>detour</i> in order to
          circumnavigate the Cape. It is now proposed to cut a
          canal across the Cape just where it juts out from the
          mainland, and thus avoid the tedious circumnavigation.
          The enormous importance of this work will be at once
          perceived. The Canal will be nearly four miles in length,
          and will be made of a uniform width of four feet, with a
          depth of two. This gigantic undertaking will of course
          cost an immense amount of time and money, but under the
          able supervision of ELKANAH HOPKINS, the gifted engineer
          who constructed the board-walk in front of Deacon
          BREWSTER'S house, at Standish Four Corners, there can be
          no doubt of its success. Advantage will be taken of the
          duck-pond of Captain JEHOIAKIM BROWN, which is situated
          in the course of the proposed canal. By leading the Canal
          directly through this pond, at least a quarter of a mile
          of excavation will be avoided. M. DE LESSEPS is known to
          have decided upon making a similar use of the Bitter
          Lakes in the construction of his Suez ditch, after having
          seen ELKANAH HOPKINS' plans for our great Cape Cod Canal.
          Vessels will hereafter pass through this Canal instead of
          taking the long voyage around the Cape; and it is
          believed that the <i>saving</i> which will be effected in
          the transportation of cod-fish and garden-sass by the
          consequent shortening of the voyage, will be something
          enormous. There are those who believe that the Canal will
          yield a yearly revenue of from eighty to ninety dollars
          in tolls alone. It is understood that the European
          Governments have already proposed to the Mayors of Boston
          and Barnstable to guarantee the neutrality of the Canal
          in case of war; but it is not possible that the
          proposition will be acceded to. Bostonians should have
          the exclusive control of this magnificent work, and the
          Selectmen of several of our prominent towns have drawn up
          petitions against the proposition of neutrality. The
          opening of the Canal will be the most splendid pageant of
          modern times. Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE will recite an
          original poem on the occasion; Mr W. H. MURRAY will
          preach a sermon; Mrs. STOWE will read a new paper on
          BYRON, and the State authorities will proclaim a solemn
          day of fasting and festivity. A procession of ten
          fishing-schooners, headed by a flat-boat, containing the
          Mayors and Selectmen of all the Massachusetts towns, will
          pass through the Canal. After this, literary exercises
          are ended; and the following month will be devoted to the
          delivery of an oration by Hon. CHARLES SUMNER, on "The
          Classical Ditches of Ancient Times, and their Influence
          on the Cause of Truth and Freedom."</p>

          <p>You, and the minor New-York papers, expect to devote
          most of your space to this wonderful undertaking. It is
          more important than any event which has taken place since
          the election of Mr. SUMNER to the Senate. It is a subject
          which will interest all your earnest readers, who will be
          greatly obliged to me for calling your attention to
          it.</p>

          <p><img src="images/04.jpg" align="left" alt="L">egs have
          heretofore been inseparable in the public mind from LYDIA
          THOMPSON. Her successes have varied inversely as the
          length of her trunk-hose. She has built up her reputation
          by "break-downs," and has clutched the burlesque diadem
          with, innumerable bounds of her elastic legs. Now,
          however, she has grown weary of offering up her fatted
          calves at the shrine of a prodigal New-York audience, and
          desires to hide the lightness of her legs under a bustle
          and crinoline. Wherefore she exchanges her PIPPIN for a
          MOSQUITO, and appears in serious instead of comic
          burlesque.</p>

          <p><i>Mosquito</i> is a play written expressly for Miss
          THOMPSON, by DUMAS <i>p&#232;re</i>. There is the
          more reason to believe this assertion, inasmuch as DUMAS,
          or somebody else, has already written it expressly for a
          variety of other people. It was written for MENKEN, under
          the title of "<i>The Pirates of the Savannah</i>," some
          six years since, and was written for somebody else and
          played at the Porte St. Martin about seventeen years ago.
          We should not be surprised if the "Veteran Observer" of
          the <i>Times</i> were prepared to prove that it was
          written expressly for him about the year 1775. In view of
          these facts, no one will regard it as improbable that it
          was also written for Miss THOMPSON. Be that as it may,
          however, there is no doubt that Miss THOMPSON appeared in
          it on Monday evening last, and that the following
          synopsis is much more accurate than even the play
          itself.</p>

          <p>After an overture, performed principally on an
          exasperating drum, the curtain rises on a scene in a
          seaport town in South America, or, to be exact, in
          Bolivia. Various disreputable pirates, whose appearance
          is a libel on a profession adorned by such men as Captain
          EYRE and the managers of cheap American republishing
          houses, conspire together in such mysterious words as
          these:</p>

          <p><i>Valderrama (a pirate chief.)</i> "To-night we
          must&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Pierre (a comic pirate.)</i> "We will, or&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Val., etc.</i> "You have your&mdash;?"</p>

          <p><i>Pierre.</i> "I have; and&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Both Together.</i> "S-s-s-s-h. Some one comes.
          Swear to&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Enter</i> LYDIA THOMPSON, <i>clothed on with
          crinoline.</i> (<i>To various pirates.</i>) "Well! How's
          things? Are you still the&mdash;?"</p>

          <p><i>Various Pirates.</i> "We are; and if&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Enter</i> BRENTANO, <i>the father of</i> LYDIA.
          <i>He addresses her in tender accents.</i> "Me cheyild,
          the hour is come. I must away. <i>(To Valderrama.)</i>
          Shall we&mdash;?"</p>

          <p><i>Val., etc.</i> "We shall. Come, my friend,
          and&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>They come. Scene changes to a lonely glen. Comic
          Pirate explains to</i> LYDIA <i>the secret of her birth
          in terms which leave it more unintelligible than ever.
          Various pirates conspire to murder</i> BRENTANO. <i>Scene
          again changes to</i> BRENTANO'S <i>garden. Various
          pirates enter and shoot the old man. Applause. Somebody
          sets the house on fire. Enter</i> LYDIA <i>disguised in
          boy's clothes. She vows eternal fidelity to</i>
          VALDERRAMA <i>The audience wildly welcome her familiar
          legs, and the curtain falls amid tempestuous applause and
          the frantic beating of the fiendish drum.</i></p>

          <p><i>Rather Dull Old Gentleman.</i> "I can't make out
          what it's all about. Why does she want to follow
          VALDERRAMA when she knows he has killed her father?"</p>

          <p><i>Theatrical Person, who has seen the manuscript
          play.</i> "Don't you see? She means to avenge herself by
          reading the <i>Nation</i> to him, or by singing Shoo-fly.
          She'll make his life a burden."</p>

          <p><i>Dull Old Gentleman.</i> "Oh! I see. But will she
          turn pirate, too?"</p>

          <p><i>Theatrical Person.</i> "By no means. There were no
          strong-minded women on the Spanish main. The pirates were
          bad enough, but they didn't have all the vices of the
          present day. She'll go to Paris with VALDERRAMA, and he
          will take the title of MARQUIS of FONSECA, and live
          sumptuously on old BRENTANO'S money. Just you wait and
          see."</p>

          <p><i>Curtain rises on second act, showing the Hotel
          Fonseca, at Paris. Several French noblemen repeat
          ponderous witticisms to one another. Enter Miss</i>
          MARKHAM <i>with clothes on. She represents the icy</i>
          DIANA DE MAULEON.</p>

          <p><i>Diana.</i> "Mon Doo! there is my lover LEON DE
          BEAULIEU. I won't have him, for he ain't rich
          enough."</p>

          <p><i>Leon.</i> "Mademosel! I love you."</p>

          <p><i>Diana.</i> "Mosshure, what's your name? who are
          your parents? and what's your income?"</p>

          <p><i>Leon.</i> "Alas! I have none."</p>

          <p><i>Diana.</i> "Then leave. Ah! Good evening, Mosshure,
          the MARQUIS DE FONSECA."</p>

          <p><i>Fonseca (aside.)</i> "LEON is the son of somebody,
          I forget who. Never mind, I'll murder him and marry
          DIANA."</p>

          <p><i>Mosquito (in other words, Lydia Thompson in a dress
          that shows her legs.)</i> "I love LEON. I must save him.
          I will save him."</p>

          <p><i>Scene changes to an inn on the coast within a few
          yards of Paris. Enter</i> PIERRE <i>and other pirates.
          They conspire to murder</i> LEON <i>and the French
          language. Enter</i> MOSQUITO <i>disguised as a serving
          maid. She dances, sings, and overhears the plot.
          Enter</i> LEON <i>in order to be murdered. By a neat
          little stratagem</i> MOSQUITO <i>contrives to have the
          pirates shoot each other, and saves</i> LEON. <i>Curtain
          falls, followed by more maddening performances on the
          drum.</i></p>

          <p><i>Dull Old Gentleman.</i> "I begin to see into it a
          little; but who is LEON, and why does FONSECA want to
          murder him?"</p>

          <p><i>Theatrical Person.</i> "Well, I can't just now
          remember. It is all cleared up in the last scene, though.
          You see, MOSQUITO is the daughter of BRENTANO, who was
          killed. She has another father who comes on later.
          Somebody else is LEON'S father, and you see FONSECA is
          the brother&mdash;no, the aunt of PIERRE&mdash;no, that's not it
          precisely&mdash;but you'll see."</p>

          <p><i>Dull Old Gentleman (doubtfully.)</i> "I hope so;
          but that infernal drum makes such a noise that I can
          hardly think. Who is that tall, awkward woman with the
          turned-up nose, who plays 'DIANA?'"</p>

          <p><i>Theatrical Person.</i> "Hush, GRANT WHITE is
          sitting right behind you. That is Miss MARKHAM, and she
          is considered to be very handsome. She is a little
          awkward in clothes, but she'll get used to them in
          time."</p>

          <p><i>The third act begins. Every body, from the Comic
          Pirate down to a Dramatic Writer who is in the play, go
          to a ball at the Palace Gardens.</i> MOSQUITO,
          <i>disguised as a Gipsy, dances and tells cheerful
          fortunes. Fonseca proposes for</i> DIANA'S <i>hand and
          roars the subject over in a private conversation with her
          father, while he and the old gentleman stand on opposite
          sides of the garden. Every body quarrels with every body
          else. The Comic Pirate challenges</i> LEON <i>to fight a
          duel, intending to murder him.</i> MOSQUITO, <i>backed by
          the</i> REGENT <i>of</i> ORLEANS <i>and the entire court,
          stops the duel and denounces</i> FONSECA. <i>The latter
          tries to murder her and is shot by the Comic Pirate. Then
          explanations take place, by which every body is proved to
          be the father or daughter of every body else, and the
          play is ended by an appropriate suggestion from the</i>
          REGENT, <i>that the entire party should engage in a
          congratulatory dance.</i></p>

          <p><i>Dull Old Gentleman.</i> "Well, I must say I don't
          understand any thing about it. I can't even make out the
          different actors. Who is the rather pretty, fat woman,
          dressed like a boy. She don't act a bit, but she dances
          nicely."</p>

          <p><i>Theatrical Person.</i> "Why, that is LYDIA
          THOMPSON. The play was written for her, you know."</p>

          <p><i>Dull Old Gentleman (evidently getting
          irritable.)</i> "All I've got to say is this, that I
          don't know which is the worse, she or the play. What is
          the stage coming to? In my day we used to have something
          like acting at the old Park. Ah, there was PLACIDE, and
          ELLEN TREE, and&mdash;"</p>

          <p>The old gentleman goes slowly out, muttering
          reminiscences from ancient history. A tall,
          intellectual-looking man is seen to withdraw into the
          grass-plat in the court-yard, and is there heard to
          appeal to the chimney-pots and stars to note the
          surpassing beauty of the vocal velvet of the fair
          MARKHAM. And the undersigned wends his way homeward with
          the conviction that <i>Hamlet</i>, with the part of
          HAMLET omitted, would be intelligible and attractive in
          comparison with LYDIA THOMPSON and PAULINE MARKHAM with
          their legs banished from public view. MATADOR.</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">PUNCHINELLO IN WALL
          STREET.</p>

          <p>The great art of Doing others as they would like to Do
          you has always commended itself to PUNCHINELLO as a very
          happy rendering of a certain fusty old rule which, in its
          original shape, did very well some nineteen hundred years
          ago, but is altogether out of date in these brisk times.
          Hence the gambols of the merry bulls in that Broad Street
          which leadeth to DIVES palace are just now highly
          entertaining. In that illustrious quarter of this amazing
          metropolis there is a beautiful game going on which is
          vastly more interesting to watch than to join in, and
          this little game is much as follows:</p>

          <p>A number of the members of that worthy family of
          undoubted ancestry and opulence, and known the world over
          as the "Cliques," have gone into the dairy business. The
          cheese-presses are kept and the churning is done in the
          big offices by the wayside; but the milking is carried on
          in a very Long Room, found, from considerable experience,
          to be peculiarly adapted to this profitable line of
          trade. Now in the pastoral realms of Finance, it is an
          odd fact that not only is the milk all cream, and golden
          cream into the bargain, but it is sometimes hard to tell
          which are the dairy-maids and which are the kindly
          animals with the crumpled horns which furnish the lacteal
          supply which is so particularly sought after. Of course
          every body wants as much cream as possible, and all have
          faith that, at the nick of time, it will be given to them
          to milk instead of the other thing. There is a pleasant
          amusement known among juveniles as "SIMON says up," etc.
          This is the very milk in the stock-market cocoanut. When
          some great member of the big Clique family cries "DANIEL
          says up," and every body shouts by mistake "DANIEL says
          down," then the Long Room does a very huge business
          indeed, and the number of cheeses made is marvellous to
          relate. When, on the contrary, Clique says "down," and
          the crowd cries "up," and it really should be up, then
          the great Clique discover that their dairy-maids have
          become the other thing, and that all the cheese is going
          the other side of the way. This is exceedingly damaging
          to the Clique firm; and as it is very painful indeed to
          be the other thing, since it makes sore heads and brings
          on a tendency to "bust," requiring much careful nursing
          to recover from the effect, the Clique family is always
          careful to arrange every thing in a manner that shall
          best insure the monopoly of the lacteal element to
          itself.</p>

          <p>At present the Cliques have made, most excellent
          provisions. It is a rule that nothing so stimulates the
          production of cream in the financial pastures as that
          curious esculent the greenback. Oddly enough, also,
          although this esculent la greatly sought after by the
          other useful animals in Uncle SAM'S plantation, yet, from
          one and another cause, vast quantities of this
          exhilarating food have been amassed in and around the
          banks of Wall street&mdash;those banks where the woodbine
          vainly twineth, and by whoso side our allegory unhappily
          lies. With plenty of greenbacks, therefore, to make every
          one gay and festive, with the pumps hard at work to keep
          the stocks well watered, and with all sorts of devices to
          lead the Street family (and a very low but ambitious and
          prolific family it is) to cry "up" when DANIEL says
          "down," the jubilant Cliques have set their mind upon a
          thriving Spring business.</p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO gazes down upon the game with equal and
          serene mind. Since all wish to milk and not to be the
          other thing, and as it is not clear which is going to be
          which, he is content to watch the cheeses as they come
          from the press, and to declare that they at least are
          seemly and good to behold. If PUNCHINELLO could only
          believe that the Street family was likely to succeed, he
          would certainly doff his cap to them. Success is
          beautiful. It is to Do others as they would Do you. That
          is the Nineteenth Century. It is, therefore, sublime. One
          gets exhausted in hurrahing for the Cliques. They are
          always getting the best of it. But the Street people need
          encouragement. It is not pleasant to be the other thing.
          And if the bloated Clique party are not some time brought
          to a turn, the day will come when we shall find all
          Clique and no cheese&mdash;a consummation devoutly <i>not</i>
          to be wished for!</p><br>

          <p>GREAT BRITAIN.</p>

          <p>Having a peculiar privilege as the correspondent of
          PUNCHINELLO, I was on the floor of the House of Commons
          when Mr. GLADSTONE made his short speech, on the 25th,
          about England and possessions. I was standing by the
          O'DONOHUE when the Minister said, "<i>A free and
          voluntary contract is the only basis for continued
          union.</i>" I whispered to O'DONOHUE&mdash;Good for Ireland!
          He did me the honor to repeat it aloud; but the
          Minister's answer was not heard.</p>

          <p>Mr. EASTWICK had just been making a speech about
          "tightening colonial relations." The <i>Press Ass</i>
          made this charge somebody or other with "making tight the
          Colonel's relations." It was just like that fellow. I
          only succeeded by chance in saving him from sending
          across some stuff about the Cardinal Archbishop of
          CRANBERRY, instead of CHAMBERY. I got a dispatch from,
          him quoting the <i>Virago</i> of Paris&mdash;meaning the
          <i>Figaro</i>, of course. And then that <i>Schema</i>; a
          Sphinx could not have made it more of a puzzle, whether
          he meant that the bishops voted that the Pope should be
          <i>deified</i>, or <i>defied</i>, or that the <i>de
          fide</i> should pass by their vote.</p>

          <p>CYRUS W. FIELD has been here, in communication with
          AIRY, the astronomer Royal, about a telegraph to the
          moon. A lunatic observation makes it wax plain that it
          will not be in wane to attempt it. STOKES and HUGGINS,
          moreover, have been taking views of people through the
          spectroscope. <i>Absorption bands</i> are very striking
          in the <i>spectra</i> of the ROTHSCHILDS and other
          bankers. <i>Bright lines</i> are seen in TENNYSON and
          WILLIAM MORRIS; <i>dark lines</i> in SWINBURNE.</p>

          <p>Gaseous substances are shown to exist in certain
          bodies and people; a great deal of gas was discovered in
          VICTOR HUGO. Traces of iron are visible in NAPOLEON III;
          and still more, at the last observations, n BISMARCK.
          VICTOR EMMANUEL had more of the phosphorus; the Pope, of
          sulphur; the PRINCE of WALES, of mercury; the editor of
          the <i>Times</i>, of lead. GARIBALDI and MAZZINI have a
          carbon-ari appearance through the instrument; with some
          look of nitrous incandescence, also. Laughing-gas is
          evidently abundant in PUNCH.</p>

          <p>The Lords of the Admiralty have observed that Mr. HALE
          has proposed in Congress a 16 million bill for a new
          American navy. It will be at once proposed to the House
          of Commons that 32 millions be spent in iron-clads here.
          And the Cabinet of the French Emperor have already
          prepared their little bill, demanding of the <i>Corps
          Legislatif</i> a sum of sixty-four millions for monster
          ships. All this is, of course, encouraging. Mr. HALE had
          better try again,</p>

          <p>Of course you have heard of the great Fenian raid,
          which really is to come off. You know there are immense
          amounts of vegetables and other provender brought to
          London from the Continent every day. Now a large number
          of sworn Fenians are to go to Holland and learn Dutch, so
          that they can go over disguised as petty dealers in food,
          get to London armed with revolvers, and carry off the
          Queen! As the Fenians always do exactly what they promise
          to do, this may be relied upon as certain to happen. It
          is said that the Queen is studying Dutch as an amusement;
          which may be very convenient on the way; she can
          expostulate with them better in Dutch than in Irish.</p>

          <p>From GERMANY, we learn that JANAUSCHEK is coming to
          London to play in English. Also that a ballet corps is
          coming over to dance in Spanish, and an opera troupe, to
          sing phonographically, in Hindoostanee. A new opera, by
          BALFE, is spoken of; subject, the Tower of Babel. This
          was suggested by the Ecumenical Council; where some body
          must have been LISET-ening.</p>

          <p>A World's Congress of Croquet Players will be held
          next month at Baden. They will not hold their debates in
          Latin. Among the points discussed will be, whether it is
          allowable to pop the question on the croquet ground. Old
          maids are quoted as thinking that it distracts the game.
          Younger ones would consider it allowable in certain
          cases.</p>

          <p>What people some travelling Americans are! There is
          one <i>nouveau riche</i> from New-York, who has been
          going about all over Germany, asking every body for the
          sculptor&mdash;he thinks his name was METTERNICH&mdash;whose most
          famous work was the <i>Status quo</i>! He wants one of
          these, he says, for his <i>jardin des plantes</i>; which
          is going to be as big as the one near Paris. He has also
          heard of the Marquis of BUTE; and wants to buy one or two
          of his things; because somebody once read to him, out of
          a copy-book, that "a thing of Bute is a joy forever." I
          have not time to tell you, today, about my late interview
          with the Pope. &mdash;PRIME</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">OUR PORT-FOLIO.</p>

          <p>Upon opening our mail, the other morning, a
          communication signed "Tragedian," purporting to come from
          the father of three boys, (each remarkable in his way,)
          particularly attracted our attention. He stated with
          peculiar succinctness some singular developments of
          genius in the second of these prodigies, which do not
          always accompany such tender adolescence. "But twelve
          years old!" exclaims the enraptured parent, "and yet my
          FRITZ has produced a tragedy in three acts, entitled 'The
          Drewid's Curse.' No less a judge than our leading town
          lawyer, squire MANGLES, was so kind as to say that such
          an instance of the histrionic flux in a child of FRITZ'S
          years, was utterly unparalleled. If PUNCHINELLO could
          find space for a few specimens of the 'Curse,' they shall
          be cheerfully furnished."</p>

          <p>(It might as well be stated here that curses of this
          character are already quite abundant, and that
          PUNCHINELLO can not find space for any of them. Still a
          kind word may not be misunderstood.)</p>

          <p>To the son of a man who spells "Druid" with a
          "<i>w</i>," all things must be possible, from a hangman's
          noose to a Presidential nomination, and the danger to be
          apprehended in this case is, that some of "Tragedian's"
          posterity may slip into one or the other of them. A
          parental raid upon all the pens, ink and paper that could
          possibly come within the reach of a youth whose soul
          revels in Druidical reminiscences, is the only effective
          remedy which at present occurs to us. The "histrionic
          flux" is a kindred disease, and would, of course, be
          susceptible of the same treatment.</p><br>
          <hr style="height: 2px; width: 15%;">
          <br>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: I am not mad, but to you, alone, I
          confide the secret of my sanity. Nevertheless I thirst
          for blood.</p>

          <p>Feelings over which I have no control, render it
          imperative that I should shoot somebody. Precisely who
          may be the victim of this insatiable desire, fate alone
          can decide. I propose some day next week to commence a
          general fusilade from the windows of my office upon the
          passers-by. My sole security in this affair, is a maiden
          aunt now in the Lunatic Asylum. I look with confidence to
          her malady as my triumphant vindication. My object in
          writing to you is to ask whether, in your opinion, the
          fact is sufficient to <i>guarantee</i> a verdict of "Not
          Guilty," in case I am prosecuted for murder, or whether
          an unscrupulous jury could sacrifice me to the unsettled
          condition of the popular mind on the subject of
          justifiable insanity. Yours sanguinarily,</p>

          <p>&mdash;RABIES.</p>
          <hr style="height: 2px; width: 15%;">

          <p>PUNCHINELLO expresses his opinion in reference to the
          above letter with great reluctance. He fears that if he
          gives his advice according to his real convictions, he
          may be overrun with similar applications, and if he gives
          advice that he doesn't feel, he will condemn "RABIES" to
          the mortification of the gallows. He therefore takes a
          middle course, and observes that the possession of an
          aunt in the Lunatic Asylum is certainly strong
          presumptive evidence that her nephew is no better than
          she is. Here in New-York, it would be difficult to upset
          such evidence, but elsewhere the result might be
          different. "RABIES" gives no clue to his whereabouts.
          PUNCHINELLO, therefore, presumes that he does not
          contemplate murder here. Very well, then, it would be
          unadvisable to kill any one, until at least two
          respectable physicians could testify that either before
          or after the act they had called upon "RABIES," fully
          interviewed him on the subject of the maiden aunt, and
          found that the slightest allusion to her was productive
          of any of the following phenomena:</p><br>

          <p>1st. Sudden and violent twitching of the eyes.</p>

          <p>2d. Discoloration of the veins of the nose, resulting
          in an appearance abnormally rubicund.</p>

          <p>3d. Manifestations of extravagant thirst, which water
          could not satisfy.</p>

          <p>4th. Tendency to reach for his boot-straps, as if with
          the view of lifting himself by the same.</p>

          <p>5th. Rapid rise of the pulse from 50 to 500&mdash;say
          within the space of ten seconds.</p>

          <p>6th. Shoo-fly! movement of the hand toward the cheek
          as if some thing had alighted there, and patient were
          trying to rub it off.</p>

          <p>7th. The presence of a cicatrix on the left temple
          (This is a most irrefutable proof of insanity).</p>

          <p>8th. Psychological developments indicative of "moral
          alienation."</p>

          <p>9th. Gangrenous condition of the tongue, proceeding
          from a disordered liver, and mysteriously communicated to
          the brain.</p>

          <p>10th. Any symptoms going to show that patient might
          mistake another man's wife for his own.</p>

          <p>11th. Discovery at the last moment that patient's
          father suffered himself to be hung for murder.</p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO offers these as the accepted <i>data</i>
          by which RABIES may measure his chances for life in case
          he executes his avowed purpose, but I would impress upon
          him the fact that these are necessary <i>outside</i> of
          New-York only. Here proof of the lunacy of the maiden
          aunt would be sufficient.</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">CONDENSED CONGRESS.</p>

          <p><b>SENATE.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/11.jpg" align="left" alt="J">ust as
          usual, WILSON had another little scheme on hand. There
          was no money in it&mdash;nothing but a little Massachusetts
          glory. It was to set apart a day to decorate the graves
          of the Union dead. Mr. WILSON remembered that it would
          have been more consonant to his own feelings to confine
          the ornamentations to the graves of colored men and the
          men of Massachusetts. But for the sake of peace and
          harmony he was willing to decorate all round.</p>

          <p>Mr. GARRETT DAVIS suggested that it didn't make any
          difference whether they set apart a day or not. If people
          wished to decorate, they would decorate, and if they
          didn't, they wouldn't.</p>

          <p>Mr. DRAKE said Mr. DAVIS'S hands were dripping with
          loyal gore.</p>

          <p>Mr. DAVIS said he would reply to that insinuation the
          first leisure week he had. In the meantime he contented
          himself with hurling the foul slander back into Mr.
          DRAKE'S teeth, if Mr. DRAKE had any.</p>

          <p>Lest Mr. DAVIS should execute his threat of making a
          speech, the Senate referred the subject.</p>

          <p>Then there was a first-class wrangle about giving
          pensions to Mrs. LINCOLN and Mrs. RAWLINGS. It was
          represented that Mrs. LINCOLN was given up to riotous
          living upon pumpernickel and ganzebroost, at a German
          watering-place, and that there was a rumor afloat that
          unless Congress pensioned her at once, she might marry a
          German prince. Mr. SHERMAN, on behalf of the Finance
          Committee, represented that German princes were
          notoriously expensive and impecunious, and that it would
          be much cheaper to pension Mrs. LINCOLN alone than to
          pension her and a German prince together. He submitted
          some statements, showing what it had cost Great Britain
          to have German princes marrying into the Royal family.
          The Senate, therefore, incontinently passed the bill.</p>

          <p>Mr. Morrill introduced a neat little swindle, which
          does equal credit to his hand and heart, providing that
          the United States should have the free use of all patents
          granted under it. He said this was to discourage that
          pernicious class of men, the inventors. In many branches
          of industry, such as arms, the Government was the only
          customer of the inventor. In those cases, the inventor's
          gray hairs would be brought immediately to the grave. And
          inasmuch as the Government had a finger in almost every
          body's pie, the future FULTONS and GOODYEARS would starve
          to death before the completion of their diabolical
          devices.</p>

          <p>Some land-grabs were rushed through, when Mr.
          SAULSBURY objected. He said nobody made any thing out of
          this except the Western Senators. He called upon the men
          of the Eastern States to stand up for their share. He had
          a little game in the interest of his own constituents. It
          was no chimerical railway. It was a good, substantial,
          practical concern. He demanded six million acres in
          behalf of the Delaware Balloon Navigation Company. If
          this demand were not complied with, it would show that
          the Senate were actuated by the basest personal
          motives.</p>

          <p><b>HOUSE.</b></p>

          <p>The gentle JULIAN insisted upon proposing his
          sixteenth or seventeenth amendment. He said that he
          understood several women intended to vote, and he
          introduced this to preserve his domestic peace.</p>

          <p>Mr. JENCKES, for the forty-fifth time, called up his
          Civil Service bill.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUTLER, for the thirty-seventh time, introduced a
          bill to annex San Domingo.</p>

          <p>Mr. KELLEY and Mr. SCHENCK raved a neat but not new
          duett, "Give us Tariff or give us Death."</p>

          <p>Mr. LOGAN gave a fine rendering of his famous bass
          solo, "The Tariff be Hanged."</p>

          <p>Mr. SCHENCK intimated that Mr. LOGAN was an insect. At
          first he said he was a pismire, but the Speaker said
          pismire was not parliamentary, and he modified it to
          grasshopper.</p>

          <p>Mr. KELLEY said that he took his stand upon American
          pig-iron, for which our fathers fought and bled. Did they
          never hear of Valley Forge? Our fathers suffered in that
          forge for the sake of protecting their children in the
          right to smelt in other forges. He said that the man who
          could smelt two pigs of iron where only one was smelted
          before, was a public benefactor.</p>

          <p>Mr. COX said he could not smelt a pig, but he thought
          he smelt a rat.</p>

          <p>Mr. JENCKES said he thought his Civil Service bill
          would tend to diminish stealing.</p>

          <p>Mr. PETERS said he would oppose it for that very
          reason. He wished to reward his friends. It was no reward
          for a man who stood by his country in her hour of peril,
          to be given an office in which he had to work for a
          living. What patriot would not be disgusted by the
          ingratitude of a country which dared to insult him like
          that? There was nothing in this bill to prevent a man
          dripping with loyal gore from holding office, if he was
          honest and intelligent; whereas, one of his, Mr. PETERS'S
          staunchest supporters might be refused an office, if he
          had the misfortune to be dishonest and dull. The notion
          of making "capacity and integrity" a qualification for
          office-holding was unprecedented, and was preposterous.
          If things went on in this way, even members of Congress
          would be compelled to do something for their pay. Now he
          preferred to administer the public service on the good
          old principle they all had practised, of "You tickle me
          and I'll tickle you."</p><br>

          contagious of all has been the <i>French</i> fever. This
          malady seems to have spread amongst all classes; the
          fashionable and the unfashionable, the strong-minded and
          the frivolous. French teachers swarm like bees, here,
          there, and every where, and all speaking the purest
          Parisian French; even Mons. L'HARMONIQUE, who comes from
          that wee little town in Canada, where the Canucks "most
          do congregate." But he says "the Americans do love so
          much humbug," that he gives them their fill of that
          article.</p>

          <p>We have had French parties, French plays, French
          lectures. We read French, speak French, sing French, and
          look French; and, if you are so barbarously ignorant as
          not to understand that language, why, you might just as
          well retire for an old fossil or petrifaction. You're
          obsolete, that's all; as much behind the times as RIP VAN
          WINKLE himself, after his memorable sleep. English is out
          of date here&mdash;a relic of the Dark Ages. Fashionable
          ladies return from Paris, bringing with them accomplished
          <i>bonnes</i>, and every one is prohibited from speaking
          a word of English to the children; but, in spite of every
          precaution, the vulgar little creatures will drop the
          musical foreign tongue, and speak their own native
          language. They are christened AD&#200;LE, MARIE, or
          CLAIRE; the SUSANS, MARYS, and ELLENS having ceased to
          exist.</p>

          <p>Parisian fashions, of course, reign triumphant, and
          the pretty young girls in French frizzes and furbelows,
          shrug their fair white shoulders exactly as they see
          "that elegant Madame DE&mdash;&mdash;" do, and gesticulate with
          what they imagine to be the true French grace and
          vivacity. They all have a charming young teacher, with
          whom they carry on a most romantic flirtation, that of
          course means nothing; and each one of these fair
          students, (who conscientiously puts a "g" to every
          termination possible, and who says <i>monseer</i>,) will
          tell you, with a complacent smile, that Professor &mdash;&mdash;
          considers her pronunciation unusually excellent. They are
          all studying in the blissful anticipation of a trip to
          Paris, where they will be presented to the Empress in
          yellow satin gowns, and then, when they return, how
          eagerly will they be sought by the fashionable young
          snobs, who long will see upon their fair brows the
          reflection of imperial glory. That is, if the dark-eyed
          ROMEOS abroad allow them ever to return to their native
          country.</p><br>

          <br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">COMIC ZOOLOGY,</p>

          <p>Order-Reptilia.</p>

          <p>SPECIES-BULLFROG.</p>

          <p>Although the batrachian is of the genus <i>bufo</i>,
          he is by no means a <i>buffo</i> genius. He may be styled
          the solemn organist of the swamp; slough music being his
          specialty. Like other out-door performers on wind
          instruments, he is chiefly heard in pleasant weather, and
          during the summer his organ is without stops. Being a
          Democrat, he appreciates the dignity of labor, and
          consequently is not ashamed to blow his own bellows.</p>

          <p>Winter shuts the bull-frog up like a four-bladed
          jack-knife, and he does not open until the blades are
          started by the Spring. He seldom leaves his mud bivouac
          for active service before April, but a Forward March
          sometimes induces him to move earlier. As a rule,
          however, the smaller varieties of the species begin to
          ply their bog-pipes some weeks before he volunteers a
          voluntary.</p>

          <p>Originally, this member of the Frog family had no
          surname, but about two thousand years ago, in consequence
          of his disastrous failure in an attempt to rival a male
          animal of the bovine species, the prefix "bull" was
          incorporated with his patronymic by a crooked little
          Greek. The name, however, more appropriately belongs to
          the Horned Frog of Sumatra.</p>

          <p>The habits of the Bull-Frog are believed by observant
          naturalists to be strictly temperate, although there is a
          rumor afloat that he has been seen Over the Bay in
          New-Jersey. It is suspected, however, that the
          originators of the story were persons who visited that
          State to avoid the restrictions of the Sunday liquor-law,
          and consequently saw as through a glass darkly. Be that
          as it may, it is certain that this species of reptiles
          (unlike the "paragon of animals,") is never too drunk to
          navigate.</p>

          <p>Mankind is deeply indebted to the Bull-Frog. We should
          never have known how to keep our heads above water but
          for their example, and, though Mr. CHASE may not be aware
          of the fact, their greenbacks were the first that ever
          issued from the Banks of America. Naturally, therefore,
          they are in advance of SALMON, and, long before he put
          our currency on its present footing, the hinder limb of a
          bull-frog was a legal tender.</p>

          <p>The frog exists in most parts of the world, and at one
          time all the varieties of the species were Plaguily
          abundant in Egypt. They were introduced there to punish
          the people for their rascality, and appeared in such
          numbers among the Egyptian blacklegs that they stopped
          the game of PHARAOH. There is nothing poetic in the
          aspect of the frog. It is simply a tenaqueous bag of
          wind, yet it has occasionally given an impulse to the
          divine <i>afflatus</i>. We have it on the authority of
          the celebrated traveller Count SMORLTORK that the
          distinguished Mrs. LEO HUNTER, once wrote an "Ode to a
          Perspiring Frog."</p>

          <p>The costume of a Bull-Frog consists of a green coat
          with yellow vest and brownish breeches, and when he
          requires a change of uniform, he pulls off the old one
          and swallows it. This fact has been doubted; but why
          should It be deemed incredible? Are there not parallel
          cases in the human family? GOLDSMITH tells us that he
          once lived for a fortnight on his coat and waistcoat; and
          every pawnbroker knows that a cast-off suit often
          furnishes the material for a family dinner. Why should
          not a frog sustain life with his Pants as well as a
          Christian?</p>

          <p>Common brown frogs are good baits for FISH in most of
          the counties in this State; but when you go to HAMILTON
          try the greenbacks.</p>

          <p>The unlicked cubs of the batrachian family are known
          (irrespective of sex) as Pollywogs, and are the meanest
          of all the reptile race except the radical Scaliwags.
          They are all heads and tails, and then, not the toss of a
          copper to choose between the two ends, as regards
          hideousness. The manner in which the tails are gradually
          developed into legs is very curious, but, as this is not
          a Caudal lecture, it is unnecessary to describe the
          process.</p>

          <p>It has been metrically stated that the fast young
          batrachian goes a wooing in an Opera hat, irrespective of
          his mother's consent, but this assertion is not borne out
          by BUFFON or CUVIER, and maybe set down as a <i>lapsus
          lyrea</i>. Upon the whole the Bull-Frog, though harmless
          as a lamb, is nearly as stupid as a donkey, which
          accounts for his taking up his abode among Morasses, when
          he might dwell in the woods with the turtle and "feel
          like a bird." Furthermore, and finally, the subject is a
          slippery one and difficult to handle, and, therefore,
          with this remark we drop it.</p><br>

          <p>A PRESBYTERIAN clergyman, the Rev. CHARLES B. SMYTHE,
          has been scandalizing a community in New-Jersey by
          putting gin in his milk, and that on a Sunday afternoon.
          From the rebuke administered to Rev. SMYTHE by the
          authorities of his church, it appears that his case must
          have been a very aggravated one. They admonished him to
          "walk more correctly in future;" the inference to be
          drawn from which is that the amount of milk-punch,
          outside of which Rev. SMYTHE had placed himself, was
          sufficient to impart a stagger to his gait.</p><br>

          <p>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</p>

          <p><i>Anxious Inquirer</i>. Can you give me any clue to
          the whereabouts of Collector BAILEY? I have advertised
          repeatedly for information concerning him without the
          slightest success.</p>

          <p>N.B. PUNCHINELLO begs to give notice that he doesn't
          keep a detective police agency, but the gentleman in
          question is said to be in <i>Esse</i>.</p>

          <p><i>Economist</i>. Is a gentleman who invites a lady to
          the theatre obliged to hire a carriage to take her
          in?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. Not at all. He can Take her In by not
          keeping his appointment, or&mdash;he can charter an omnibus if
          he likes.</p>

          <p><i>Vinous</i>. Can you give me any information about
          high wines and dry wines? Can wines be high and not dry,
          or both high and dry, or how? Please explain. Was HENRI
          do BOURBON the last of the Bourbons?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i> I. DELMONICO'S <i>Clos Vouguet</i> at
          $16 per bottle is a high wine but not a dry wine. It
          might be, though, if it wasn't wet. II. Not by a good
          many.</p>

          <p>X. Please, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, who were CASTOR and
          POLLUX?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. Twins. (By Gemini you ought to have
          known that!)</p>

          <p><i>Scissors</i>. Where can I have access to old files
          of the leading news-papers?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. In the editorial rooms of the same. You
          must be brief, however, as their time is valuable, and
          these Old Files are apt to be crusty, if bored.</p>

          <p><i>Old Salt</i>. How can sea-sickness be avoided?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. By never going to sea.</p>

          <p><i>Linnaeus</i>. Does a knowledge of botany
          necessarily involve a knowledge of square root and cube
          root?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. Our correspondent is evidently trying
          to quiz us. PUNCHINELLO will pay no attention to levity
          of this sort.</p>

          <p><i>Claude</i>. I desire to make a few presents to a
          young lady who is intellectual but very timid. What shall
          I give her?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. Presents of Mind.</p>

          <p><i>M.C.</i> I am going to buy a new faro-table for my
          place up-town&mdash;you know where. What is the best shape and
          material?</p>

          <p><i>Answer</i>. A Square Deal table generally suite
          <i>players</i> the best.</p>

          <p><i>Williams</i>. No, sir; the term Fiscal year has no
          reference to Col. FISK, Jr.</p>

          <p><i>Gardener</i>. Haydn's Book of Dates is not a
          Horticultural book.</p>

          <p><i>Byron, Jr</i>. Your verses would be much better if
          you would pay less attention to your Feet and more to
          your Head.</p>

          <p><i>M.J.B.</i> Dear Mr. PUNCHINELLO: Our darling little
          pet, Tinkums, is not well, and does nothing but cry all
          night, to Charlie's great vexation. What will stop the
          little darling's crying?</p>

          <p>We would suggest a hot pitch plaster directly over the

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">SAILING DIRECTIONS</p>

          <p>FOR ENTERING AND LEAVING YOKOHAMA BAY.</p>

          <p>From our special correspondent if Washington we have
          received the following Special Order of the Navy
          Department, directing United States men-of-war how to
          approach and leave Yokohama:</p>

          <p>SPECIAL ORDER NO. 999.</p>

          <p>In consequence of the late disaster to the U.S. sloop
          Oneida, the following rules are hereby published for the
          guidance of vessels of war approaching the Bay of
          Yokohama:</p>

          <p>I. On making the land, or if at night, on striking the
          soundings, all hands will be called to prayers.</p>

          <p>II. After prayers all boats will be lowered and towed
          astern, to be out of the way of damage.</p>

          <p>III. The gunner, under direction of the executive
          officer, will dismount all guns, and strike them into the
          hold. The reasons for this action will be at once
          apparent to commanders of vessels, when they reflect
          that, in case of collision, the guns would be useless as
          signals, owing to the extraordinary deafness of the
          officers belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Mail
          Steamship Company; and a reference to the details of the
          Oneida's disaster will show the danger of the guns
          breaking loose and destroying human life. They will,
          therefore, be at once stowed in the hold.</p>

          <p>IV. On entering the bay, the helm must be kept
          amidships. The rule of the road, according to English
          interpretation, is so difficult of comprehension that the
          above is by far the safest plan.</p>

          <p>V. Each officer and man will be directed to secure
          upon his person such valuables belonging to him as he can
          conveniently carry.</p>

          <p>VI. Finally, it shall be the duty of the commander to
          see that all hands are provided with life-preservers.</p>

          <p>VII. The same rules will apply to vessels leaving
          Yokohama and proceeding to sea.</p>

          <p>VIII. Having taken the above precautions, vessels may
          stand boldly into the bay, and in case they are run into
          and sunk by any other vessel (say for example one of the
          Peninsular and Oriental Company's ships) their officers
          and men will stand some little chance of saving their
          lives. But should all precautions fail, the gallant crew
          will be no doubt greatly consoled, as they sink to their
          graves, by the reflection that a pious Congress will pass
          resolutions of sympathy for their widows and
          orphans.</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">A PLEA FOR PROTECTION.</p>

          <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO: I like your paper, though it is
          altogether too light and trifling in its treatment of
          serious subjects. Besides, it never treats of any thing
          serious. This won't do. The earnest men and women of the
          nation require something better at your hands. I have an
          essay on the "Origin of Evil," which I forward to you by
          this mail, and which, when published, will give an
          entirely different character to your journal. I want you,
          moreover, to advocate our American doctrine of
          Protection. Even our ablest statesmen, KELLEY, GREELEY,
          and DANIEL PRATT, have never carried this doctrine far
          enough. They are willing to protect American iron-masters
          by prohibiting the introduction of foreign iron, but why
          don't they protect American laborers by forbidding
          foreign workmen to land on our shores? I demand
          protection for the native ditcher. Forbid the Irishmen to
          land here and to lower the price of labor by competing
          with our own ditch-diggers. Put a stop to the influx of
          German tailors and bootmakers, who prevent native artists
          from earning the wages that would otherwise be theirs.
          Protect our authors by prohibiting the sale of works
          written by foreigners. Keep all foreign pictures out of
          the country, and give our own POWELLS and ROSSITERS a
          chance. And, above all, protect our American girls by
          preventing any pretty English, French, or German girls
          from coming in competition with them. These foreign girls
          bring their pretty faces here and glut the matrimonial
          market. The fewer the marriageable girls, the higher
          their market value. We protect iron-workers, and decline
          to protect our own daughters. This is an outrage. Shall
          we prevent the railroad companies from laying rails made
          of foreign iron, and permit husbands to marry foreign
          wives? Every patriotic and protectionist instinct revolts
          against it. I want you to take this matter up. Let us
          have no more foreign manufactures, foreign iron, foreign
          books, foreign laborers, or foreign girls. This is the
          true American system, and I look to you to aid in

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">PUNCHINELLO IS SORRY.</p>

          <p><img src="images/14.jpg" align="left" alt="A">las! it
          is with tears in his eyes, albeit unaccustomed to such
          humor, that PUNCHINELLO condoles with the ladies of
          Massachusetts on the defeat of the proposition to endow
          them with the right of suffrage. The Puritan Patriots in
          the State Legislature, who unanimously recognize the
          "inborn right" of the black field-hands of South Carolina
          and Georgia to make laws for the white women of the
          Republic, have scornfully denied, by a vote of 133 to 68,
          that the white women aforesaid have any political rights
          at all; thus officially proclaiming to the world that
          they consider their wives, their daughters, and the
          mothers that bore them, inferior to the ignorant male
          African; unworthy to vote with him at the polls or to sit
          with him in council.</p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO is aware that the ladies of Massachusetts
          had set their hearts upon rising to the negro level
          "before the law," and can therefore appreciate their
          disappointment; but they ought to have known that neither
          the ties of nature, the bonds of wedlock, nor the claims
          of intelligence, are of any force in the Home of the
          Pilgrims, as compared with the influence of the Ebony
          Lords of Creation, whoso reign as sovereigns commenced
          with the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>

          <p>The STANTONS, the BLACKWELLS, and the ANTHONYS, the
          Members of the Women's Parliament and the Sisters of
          Sorosis, advocated negro suffrage with the full
          expectation of sharing the franchise with PETE and CUFF;
          but alas! while these wool-dyed Africans are conducted in
          triumph to the ballot-box, <i>they</i> are ignominiously
          thrust back from it. For this black wrong there is no
          colorable pretext. There is not a shade of excuse for it,
          and PUNCHINELLO hopes that it will open the eyes of the
          ladies of the land, and prevent them henceforth and for
          ever from placing the slightest confidence in the
          gallantry or impartiality of the Puritanic prigs of
          New-England.</p><br>

          <p><i>D.</i> Now then, father, for that Description of
          the Telescope!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Very well, my child. The great Object of the
          telescope&mdash;</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Is the Object-Glass, is it not, father?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Come, come, HELENE; no nonsense, now. The
          great object had in view by the inventors of the
          telescope&mdash;</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Father, don't you mean the Great Object they
          <i>expected</i> to have in view, when they got it made; a
          Distant World, for instance?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Pshaw, child! be serious. Don't spoil a good
          thing by untimely interjections. They are as mal
          &#224; propos as a mosquito coming across the Field
          of View.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> I'd rather he'd do that than come across
          <i>me!</i></p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, HELENE, you are positively
          exasperating!</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Not more so than your mosquito.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, I declare&mdash;this is too bad!</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> So is his bite!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, well; I must walk out and take the
          air. [<i>Going</i>]</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Yes, pa, (and see that you don't take
          anything else!) Now, then! for a grand look for my
          Charmer! Really, I am getting quite Earthly! [<i>Looks
          through the instrument a few moments</i>] Why, what is
          this? Oh, pshaw! I see! I've got JUPITER by mistake! I
          mistook one of his Belts for a new Belt Railroad. It
          would have been a Big Thing, that railroad; not less than
          75,000 miles long, as I figure it. Perhaps those Belts
          <i>are</i> Railroads! Perhaps they have Rings there, as
          they have at Saturn, only less conspicuous. JUPITER is
          rather a Slushy planet, if I am correct in regard to its
          Specific Gravity; of about the consistency, perhaps, of
          the New-York Poultice Pavement I've been reading about. I
          should think that JUPITER'S lack of gravity and
          consistency would make him a favorite with Aldermen&mdash;not
          the less for having so many Satellites. I wonder if the
          New Charter is the celebrated Magna Charter under a new
          name? Probably it is no better. Oh, dear! the annoyance
          of living so far away! Nothing here attracts me. The
          distant, the unattainable, is all I think or care
          about!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> [<i>Coming in quietly.</i>] What's that,
          HELENE, about the charms of the Unattainable? You don't
          seem to see any thing very attractive in MERCURY or
          MARS!</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Well, some things may be both unattainable
          and undesirable. That's the case with the little thieving
          god MERCURY, and that big red-skinned Prize-Fighter,
          MARS. I can't understand, however, why these disreputable
          deities should he worshipped in your favorite
          New-York.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, as near as I can see, (a matter of a
          few million miles, more or less,) when you speak of
          Worship, they have more regard there for Millinery than
          any thing else. The Christian Religion is based on
          Humility, which has Purity and Simplicity for her
          Handmaids. Look into some of these New-York churches! see
          how the jewels glisten, the rich stuffs fall gracefully
          in massive folds. Observe the sumptuousness, the
          elaborate display! A fine Humility this! Then look at the
          ceremonial. Here is a church edifice, belonging to a
          denomination that assumes to be Decent and Orderly in
          ceremony. Is it so in <i>this</i> church? What means all
          this tawdriness of color, the crimson, the blue, the
          gold; what signify these fantastic designs and figures,
          these monkey-like genuflexions; this wilderness of sign
          and symbol, this elaborate abasement, this theatrical
          show of exaltation? This an improvement on the old
          dignified simplicity? Do you tell me that childishness,
          and prettiness, and pettiness, are valid substitutes for
          a genuine, manly modesty and simplicity?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> (Oh, dear! he's been drinking again! How
          bitter the Bitters do make him!) Look! Father, come,
          quick! Here is a Railroad Accident, such as you have
          often wished to see. Two trains have collided, and both
          have rolled down an embankment at least seventy feet
          high! into a river, I do declare! They are all lost!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Do let me see at once, HELENE I [<i>Looks
          eagerly.</i>] Ah, yes; all gone; nothing visible but one
          smoke-pipe, three stove-pipe hats, four bits of
          orange-peel, some pea-nut shells, and thirteen copies of
          the <i>New-York Ledger</i>. Sad fate! But see! Some
          dry-goods-no, a young lady flounders along toward the
          shore! The bystanders rush up; she is nearly exhausted;
          pants rapidly; they congratulate her. A well-dressed
          young man approaches. She instantly begins to think of
          her looks; her hand flies to her back hair. Heavens!
          there is so much gone there that she shrieks in alarm!
          Her fall in the water has detached her Waterfall!
          <i>That</i> gone, every thing is gone! She springs to her
          feet! Glancing hurriedly over the watery waste, now
          plentifully strewn with fans, little canes, and certain
          objects which are either mail-bags or <i>chignons</i>,
          she descries her better part, and with a wild cry, (as
          when a mother rescues her babe from tigers,) dashes in
          and seizes the darling object! She presses it to her
          lips, and impetuously breaks for the shore! Alas! too
          late, by about ten and a half seconds! "Save it!" she
          seems to cry; tosses the wad ashore, and down she goes,
          with her hand on the back of her head, her last thoughts,
          evidently, more or less, connected with that sympathizing
          young man on the bank above.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Father, you talk like a brute! Have you no
          feeling? Boo-hoo hoo-hoo!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Child, I am <i>all</i> feeling.

          <p>KITCHEN GARDEN.&mdash;Plant pickles early, if you are up in
          time; if not, later. But don't eat them late, unless you
          are equally fond of dyspepsia.</p>

          <p>In planting peas, select that kind that does not grow
          hard and yellow; that is, unless you supply
          boarding-houses, or have a government contract for the
          supply of shot.</p>

          <p>Grated turnips, mixed with horse-radish, for the
          table, will assuage one's grief for one's

          <p>Rice-puddings can be grown, ready-made, by sowing rice
          with cowcumbers. Try it.</p>

          <p>NURSERY.&mdash;Transplant from hot-beds to bath-tub as soon
          as possible, using sponge with palm-soap and cold water.
          Top-dress with comb and brush. Trim limbs according to
          age. Train with rods. Much depends on starting right, so
          start to school right after breakfast.</p><br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
